Benchmarking suite for the AEminium runtime.

Developed in distinct phases:

* Compiler
	A java to java compiler that translates regular java (within limitations) to
	AEminium Tasks and Runtime

* Unit Tester
	A jUnit project that validates the results of the compiler

* Benchmark
	An automated benchmarking script that lauches several sets of tests.

TODO:
	main() function
	
	method body:
		transform "this" to "this._this";
		transform "return" to "this._ret = ";
