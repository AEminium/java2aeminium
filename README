Benchmarking suite for the AEminium runtime.

Developed in distinct phases:

* Compiler
	A java to java compiler that translates regular java (within limitations) to
	AEminium Tasks and Runtime

* Unit Tester
	A jUnit project that validates the results of the compiler

* Benchmark
	An automated benchmarking script that lauches several sets of tests.

TODO:
	Build EAST
	
	Optimize EAST
		-> select nodes to paralellize and nodes to serialize
		conservative rule:
			nodes with 0 or 1 childs can be serialized without loss of paralellism   

	Translate EAST


FIXME:
	after a conditional statement (if, while, statement) task has been executed it should be possible to
	cancel child tasks:
		it can be done by modifying the code, or directly allowing it in the runtime
		(maybe having execute return a boolean?)

	if (.........)
		return x;

	x.method()
