Benchmarking suite for the AEminium runtime.

Developed in distinct phases:

* Compiler
	A java to java compiler that translates regular java (within limitations) to
	AEminium Tasks and Runtime

* Unit Tester
	A jUnit project that validates the results of the compiler

* Benchmark
	An automated benchmarking script that lauches several sets of tests.
	
TODO:
	Variable dependencies (SimpleName, and QualifiedName)
	
	

	after a conditional statement (if, while, statement) task has been executed it should be possible to
	cancel child tasks:
		it can be done by modifying the code, or directly allowing it in the runtime
		(maybe having execute return a boolean? or call a Runtime.removeChilds(asdasd) )

	if (.........)
		return x;

	x.method()
