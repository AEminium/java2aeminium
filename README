Developed in distinct phases:

* Compiler
	A java to java compiler that translates regular java (within limitations) to
	AEminium Tasks and Runtime

* Unit Tester
	A jUnit project that validates the results of the compiler

* Benchmark
	An automated benchmarking script that lauches several sets of tests.
